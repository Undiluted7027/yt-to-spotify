# yt-to-spotify
Converts YT playlists to Spotify

## Motivation
I used to stream songs on Spotify but over time I realized that Spotify's recommendation was a bummer. It wasn't able to understand my song taste and when they removed the option to select exactly the song you'd want to play and just play it from a playlist that they created, I decided to switch to YopuTube music. But I still wanted to use Spotify since streaming quality in general was better on Spotify. So I decided to convert my YouTube Music Playlists to Spotify.

## Method
This project uses python alongwith Google Cloud YouTube API and Spotify API.
It basically takes in playlist ID of youtube, searches for those songs on Spotify and then pushes them into a Spotify playlist.

## Areas to work on
- Song search on Spotify can be improved with regex
- Reduce user hassle by finding playlist ID by itself rather than taking a user-input
- A Spotify to YouTube Music counterpart can also be created

## How can you use?
